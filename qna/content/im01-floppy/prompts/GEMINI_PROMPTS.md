# Gemini 프롬프트 — 이게 모예요? ① 플로피디스크

> `video/scripts/prompts.mjs` 가 만든 파일이다. 직접 고치지 말고 `content/im01-floppy/script/art.json` 을 고친 뒤 `npm run prompts` 를 다시 실행한다.
> 이 편에만 쓰는 그림 9장. 진행: 0 / 9
> 다 넣었으면 `video/` 에서 `npm run make -- im01` → `video/out/im01/im01.mp4`

## 사용법

1. 위에서부터 **차례대로** 한 블록씩 Gemini에 붙여넣는다. 화풍 문장은 블록마다 이미 들어 있다.
2. 블록의 **첨부** 이미지를 **빠짐없이, 적힌 순서대로** 같이 올린다 (프롬프트가 "attached image 2" 처럼 번호로 부른다). 첨부 목록은 `art-lib.mjs` 의 `attachPlan` 이 정한다 — 손으로 빼거나 바꾸지 않는다. 첨부가 하나라도 실패하면 글자만 보내지 말고 멈춘다. 규칙 전체는 `qna/ART_GUIDE.md`.
   ⚠️ 줄이 있는 블록은 기준 그림이 빠졌거나 아직 없는 것이다 — 그것부터 고친다.
3. 결과는 **저장** 경로와 이름 그대로 넣는다. 배경 제거·자르기·크기 조절은 하지 않는다 (`npm run art` 가 한다).
4. 한 사람은 **한 대화창**에서 끝내고, 다음 사람·배경은 새 대화창에서 시작한다. 대화가 길어지면 화풍이 흐려진다.
5. 글자는 그리지 않는다. 자막·간판·연도는 영상 코드가 얹는다.
6. 제목 옆 ✅ 는 이미 파일이 있다는 뜻이다 (`npm run prompts` 를 다시 돌리면 갱신된다).
7. **말하는 그림**(이름이 `-b` 로 끝나는 것)은 첫 번째 프레임을 ②로 첨부해 "입만 바꿔 다시 그리기"로 만든다. 두 장의 크기와 자리가 같아야 입만 움직여 보인다.

### 다시 뽑을 때 이어서 보내는 문장

| 문제 | 문장 |
|---|---|
| 배경이 단색 초록이 아님 | `Redo it with a perfectly flat pure green #00FF00 background, no shadow, no floor.` |
| 몸이 잘림 | `Zoom out so the whole body fits with empty margin on every side.` |
| 다른 사람처럼 나옴 | `Keep the exact same face, hair and clothes as attached image 2. Only change the pose.` |
| 글자가 들어감 | `Remove all text and letters; leave signs blank.` |
| 화풍이 순해짐 | `More grotesque gag-manga exaggeration, like the first attached image: bigger mouth, bulging eyes, more sweat.` |
| 배경에 사람이 있음 | `Remove every person. Background only.` |
| 말하는 그림의 몸이 달라짐 | `Too different. Copy attached image 2 exactly and change only the mouth.` |
| 무대 장면에 주인공이 있음 | `Remove the main character and leave that spot empty; it is added later as a separate cutout.` |

## 1. 아직 없는 그림 — 9장 (이것만 Gemini 에서 만든다)

#### 1. 배경 — 할머니 집 다락 (아빠 어릴 적 상자)
- 저장: `content/im01-floppy/art/bg/attic.png`
- 첨부 1장 (빠짐없이, 이 순서로): ① `content/_common/art/anchor/style-cutin.png` (화풍 앵커)
- 종류 · 비율: 배경 (사람 없음) · 16:9
- 쓰이는 컷: c00, c01, c02, c03, c05, c06, c07

```text
Japanese gag-manga sticker illustration style. Grotesquely exaggerated comedic expressions, huge open mouths with detailed teeth and gums, bulging eyes, sweat drops, wrinkles. Semi-realistic airbrushed skin shading with glossy highlights. Big head, short stocky body (about 2.5 heads tall). Thin brown-black ink linework, saturated colors, clean edges. Korean setting, Korean people unless stated otherwise. No text, no letters, no numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signature.

Background art only, absolutely no people and no characters. A flat, straight-on stage-like view (like a sitcom set), camera at chest height, no extreme perspective.

Match the art style of the first attached image exactly: same line weight, same skin shading, same color saturation, same level of exaggeration.

The cozy attic storage room of a Korean grandmother's house, seen straight-on like a sitcom set: a slanted wooden ceiling with one small round window letting in warm afternoon light and floating dust specks, stacked old cardboard boxes, one open cardboard box in the middle front with old school notebooks, a rolled-up childhood poster and a dusty toy robot peeking out, an old wooden chest, a folded children's desk. Warm, nostalgic, golden light. All boxes and papers completely blank, no writing.

The camera will slowly pan and zoom across this picture, so paint about 8% extra scenery at every edge and keep nothing important within that margin.

Keep the bottom third of the picture an open, uncluttered floor: characters will be placed there later. All signs, posters, screens and labels are blank shapes with no text. 16:9 landscape, highest resolution.

Semi-realistic airbrushed skin shading with glossy highlights. Big head, short stocky body (about 2.5 heads tall). Thin brown-black ink linework, saturated colors, clean edges. Korean setting, Korean people unless stated otherwise. No text, no letters, no numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signature.

This is one complete illustrated scene for an explainer video, composed like a single manga panel.

Match the art style of the first attached image exactly: same line weight, same skin shading, same color saturation, same level of exaggeration.

Attached image 2 shows the kid: draw this person with exactly the same face, hairstyle, hair color, clothes, colors and body shape.

Attached image 3 shows the dad: draw this person with exactly the same face, hairstyle, hair color, clothes, colors and body shape.

Also in the picture: the kid: an 8-year-old Korean child with a black bowl-cut, huge round curious eyes, one missing front tooth, wearing a red hoodie, navy shorts and white socks; small, fearless and very direct.

Also in the picture: the dad: a Korean father in his late 30s, slightly chubby with a round face, short black hair that is clearly thinning on top, thick eyebrows, faint stubble, wearing a mustard-yellow knit cardigan over a white t-shirt, gray sweatpants and house slippers; a kind but easily flustered look.

In a warm, dusty attic, the kid kneels by an open old cardboard box and lifts out a small blue square plastic computer diskette with a silver metal sliding shutter at the top, holding it up curiously with both hands. Behind him the dad leans in, his eyes going wide with sudden recognition. Golden afternoon light, dust specks sparkling. The diskette label and the box are completely blank, no writing, no logos.

The camera will slowly pan and zoom across this picture, so paint about 8% extra scenery at every edge and keep nothing important within that margin.

Keep the main subject in the middle and leave the top-left corner calm (a caption is added there later). All signs and labels are blank shapes with no text. 16:9 landscape, highest resolution.

Semi-realistic airbrushed skin shading with glossy highlights. Big head, short stocky body (about 2.5 heads tall). Thin brown-black ink linework, saturated colors, clean edges. Korean setting, Korean people unless stated otherwise. No text, no letters, no numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signature.

This is a character cutout for a 2D animated video: bold readable silhouette, oversized head and face, clear colors with soft shading.

Match the art style of the first attached image exactly: same line weight, same skin shading, same color saturation, same level of exaggeration.

The character must be exactly the same person as in attached image 2: same face, hairstyle, hair color, clothes, colors and body shape. Only the pose and expression change.

Character: the dad: a Korean father in his late 30s, slightly chubby with a round face, short black hair that is clearly thinning on top, thick eyebrows, faint stubble, wearing a mustard-yellow knit cardigan over a white t-shirt, gray sweatpants and house slippers; a kind but easily flustered look.

3/4 view turned slightly to the LEFT. Holding a small blue square computer diskette with a silver metal shutter up in front of his chest with both hands, gazing at it with misty, sparkling nostalgic eyes, a big soft trembling smile, cheeks flushed, a single happy tear in the corner of one eye. The diskette label is blank.

Comic effect marks (sweat drops, shock lines, sparkles) may surround the character but must stay close to the body.

The cutout will be animated (hopping, tilting, sliding across the screen), so draw one clear, strongly readable pose with the arms and anything held kept away from the torso, both feet on the same ground line, and nothing cropped.

Full body, the entire character visible from head to toe with a small empty margin on every side, not cropped, centered. Portrait 2:3 aspect ratio.

Solid flat pure green (#00FF00) background filling everything around the subject: no floor, no cast shadow, no gradient, no scenery, no effects or objects outside the subject.

A 1990s Korean elementary-school computer room in faded sepia tones like an old photograph: rows of chunky beige computers with boxy CRT monitors and beige keyboards on long tables. The dad, looking exactly as he does now (same adult face and thinning hair), is comically dressed as an elementary-school boy: a yellow kids' cap, a striped T-shirt, short pants and a small backpack, sitting on a tiny school chair far too small for him, proudly pushing a small blue square diskette into the slot of a beige computer with a big satisfied grin. All screens show only plain glowing blue color, no text, no letters, no logos.

The camera will slowly pan and zoom across this picture, so paint about 8% extra scenery at every edge and keep nothing important within that margin.

Sepia-toned 1990s flashback like an old photograph: a school hallway with lockers. The dad, looking exactly as he does now (same adult face and thinning hair) but comically dressed as an elementary-school boy in a yellow kids' cap, striped T-shirt, short pants and a small backpack, secretively holds out a fan of colorful square computer diskettes like playing cards, wiggling his eyebrows with a sly grin. Another small schoolboy, seen only from behind, reaches for one. All diskette labels completely blank, no writing.

A silly bright imagined scene high in a blue sky: the dad stands proudly on top of a fluffy white cloud like a shelf, stacking paper folders, photo albums and a teddy bear neatly on the cloud, then pointing at them with a satisfied smug grin. Other clouds around him are also piled with folders and photo frames. Bright, absurd and cheerful. All folders, papers and frames completely blank, no writing.
