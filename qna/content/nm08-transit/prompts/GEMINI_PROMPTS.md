# Gemini 프롬프트 — 내모남불 ⑧ 대중교통편 · 자리 · 자는 척 · 통화 · 커피

> `video/scripts/prompts.mjs` 가 만든 파일이다. 직접 고치지 말고 `content/nm08-transit/script/art.json` 을 고친 뒤 `npm run prompts` 를 다시 실행한다.
> 이 편에만 쓰는 그림 24장. 진행: 3 / 24
> 다 넣었으면 `video/` 에서 `npm run make -- nm08` → `video/out/nm08/nm08.mp4`

## 사용법

1. 위에서부터 **차례대로** 한 블록씩 Gemini에 붙여넣는다. 화풍 문장은 블록마다 이미 들어 있다.
2. 블록의 **첨부** 이미지를 **빠짐없이, 적힌 순서대로** 같이 올린다 (프롬프트가 "attached image 2" 처럼 번호로 부른다). 첨부 목록은 `art-lib.mjs` 의 `attachPlan` 이 정한다 — 손으로 빼거나 바꾸지 않는다. 첨부가 하나라도 실패하면 글자만 보내지 말고 멈춘다. 규칙 전체는 `qna/ART_GUIDE.md`.
   ⚠️ 줄이 있는 블록은 기준 그림이 빠졌거나 아직 없는 것이다 — 그것부터 고친다.
3. 결과는 **저장** 경로와 이름 그대로 넣는다. 배경 제거·자르기·크기 조절은 하지 않는다 (`npm run art` 가 한다).
4. 한 사람은 **한 대화창**에서 끝내고, 다음 사람·배경은 새 대화창에서 시작한다. 대화가 길어지면 화풍이 흐려진다.
5. 글자는 그리지 않는다. 자막·간판·연도는 영상 코드가 얹는다.
6. 제목 옆 ✅ 는 이미 파일이 있다는 뜻이다 (`npm run prompts` 를 다시 돌리면 갱신된다).
7. **말하는 그림**(이름이 `-b` 로 끝나는 것)은 첫 번째 프레임을 ②로 첨부해 "입만 바꿔 다시 그리기"로 만든다. 두 장의 크기와 자리가 같아야 입만 움직여 보인다.

### 다시 뽑을 때 이어서 보내는 문장

| 문제 | 문장 |
|---|---|
| 배경이 단색 초록이 아님 | `Redo it with a perfectly flat pure green #00FF00 background, no shadow, no floor.` |
| 몸이 잘림 | `Zoom out so the whole body fits with empty margin on every side.` |
| 다른 사람처럼 나옴 | `Keep the exact same face, hair and clothes as attached image 2. Only change the pose.` |
| 글자가 들어감 | `Remove all text and letters; leave signs blank.` |
| 화풍이 순해짐 | `More grotesque gag-manga exaggeration, like the first attached image: bigger mouth, bulging eyes, more sweat.` |
| 배경에 사람이 있음 | `Remove every person. Background only.` |
| 말하는 그림의 몸이 달라짐 | `Too different. Copy attached image 2 exactly and change only the mouth.` |
| 무대 장면에 주인공이 있음 | `Remove the main character and leave that spot empty; it is added later as a separate cutout.` |

Japanese gag-manga sticker illustration style. Grotesquely exaggerated comedic expressions, huge open mouths with detailed teeth and gums, bulging eyes, sweat drops, wrinkles. Semi-realistic airbrushed skin shading with glossy highlights. Big head, short stocky body (about 2.5 heads tall). Thin brown-black ink linework, saturated colors, clean edges. Korean setting, Korean people unless stated otherwise. No text, no letters, no numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signature.

This is a character cutout for a 2D animated video: bold readable silhouette, oversized head and face, clear colors with soft shading.

Match the art style of the first attached image exactly: same line weight, same skin shading, same color saturation, same level of exaggeration.

The character must be exactly the same person as in attached image 2: same face, hairstyle, hair color, clothes, colors and body shape. Only the pose and expression change.

Character: the station attendant: a Korean woman in her early thirties, neat low bun of black hair, a calm oval face with straight eyebrows and composed narrow eyes, thin lips; wearing a tidy navy-blue station staff uniform jacket with a white shirt collar, a navy skirt-length vest, white gloves, a small black walkie-talkie clipped at her shoulder and a plain navy cap; absolutely NO text, NO letters, NO name tags, NO badges and NO logos anywhere; perfectly polite, completely deadpan.

3/4 view turned slightly to the LEFT. Holding the small black walkie-talkie up near her mouth with one white-gloved hand as if making an announcement, the other hand raised with an open palm toward the viewer in a polite stop gesture, deadpan face.

Comic effect marks (sweat drops, shock lines, sparkles) may surround the character but must stay close to the body.

The cutout will be animated (hopping, tilting, sliding across the screen), so draw one clear, strongly readable pose with the arms and anything held kept away from the torso, both feet on the same ground line, and nothing cropped.

Full body, the entire character visible from head to toe with a small empty margin on every side, not cropped, centered. Portrait 2:3 aspect ratio.

Solid flat pure green (#00FF00) background filling everything around the subject: no floor, no cast shadow, no gradient, no scenery, no effects or objects outside the subject.

Character: the bus driver: the IDENTICAL TWIN sister of the station attendant — exactly the same face, same low bun of black hair, same straight eyebrows and composed narrow eyes; wearing a light sky-blue bus driver uniform shirt with a navy tie and white gloves; absolutely NO text, NO letters, NO name tags, NO badges and NO logos anywhere; perfectly polite, completely deadpan.

3/4 view turned slightly to the LEFT. One white-gloved arm stretched straight forward with the palm facing the viewer in a firm polite STOP gesture, the other hand on her hip, deadpan face, eyes half-lidded.

Comic effect marks (sweat drops, shock lines, sparkles) may surround the character but must stay close to the body.

Korean setting, Korean people unless stated otherwise. No text, no letters, no numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signature.

This is a large close-up reaction shot for a comedy video: maximum facial detail, extreme exaggeration, dramatic lighting on the face.

Match the art style of the first attached image exactly: same line weight, same skin shading, same color saturation, same level of exaggeration.

The character must be exactly the same person as in attached image 2: same face, hairstyle, hair color, clothes, colors and body shape. Only the pose and expression change.

Facing the viewer, dramatic close-up from the chest up. A perfectly flat deadpan stare, one white-gloved finger raised like making a point, the walkie-talkie at her shoulder, a single small sweat-free calm expression, soft blue station light behind her.

Comic effect marks (sweat drops, shock lines, sparkles) may surround the character but must stay close to the body.

Chest-up close-up, the face fills most of the frame, centered, not cropped. Square 1:1 aspect ratio.

Solid flat pure green (#00FF00) background filling everything around the subject: no floor, no cast shadow, no gradient, no scenery, no effects or objects outside the subject.

Korean setting, Korean people unless stated otherwise. No text, no letters, no numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signature.

Background art only, absolutely no people and no characters. A flat, straight-on stage-like view (like a sitcom set), camera at chest height, no extreme perspective.

Match the art style of the first attached image exactly: same line weight, same skin shading, same color saturation, same level of exaggeration.

A bright, clean Korean subway station concourse in the morning seen straight-on like a sitcom set: a row of silver ticket gates with small glowing card readers, a tiled floor, a big blank route map board on the wall made only of colored lines and dots, ceiling lights. No people. Absolutely no readable words, letters, numbers, route numbers, station names or logos anywhere; no caption boxes, no speech bubbles, no frame border.

The camera will slowly pan and zoom across this picture, so paint about 8% extra scenery at every edge and keep nothing important within that margin.

Keep the bottom third of the picture an open, uncluttered floor: characters will be placed there later. All signs, posters, screens and labels are blank shapes with no text. 16:9 landscape, highest resolution.

The inside of a Korean subway car seen straight-on from the aisle like a sitcom set: a long row of light-green bench seats, a few seats in a different color for priority seating marked only by a simple wheelchair-and-elder pictogram, hanging hand straps, silver poles, windows showing a dark tunnel with motion streaks, a blank electronic display strip above the doors. No people. Absolutely no readable words, letters, numbers, route numbers, station names or logos anywhere; no caption boxes, no speech bubbles, no frame border.

A Korean city bus stop on a sunny morning seen straight-on: a glass bus shelter with a bench, a blank route sign made of plain colored bars, a street with trees and apartment buildings in the background.

The inside of a Korean city bus at night seen from the aisle: rows of blue fabric seats, yellow hand rails and stop buttons, dim warm interior lights, windows showing streaking orange city lights, the empty driver seat area at the front.

Semi-realistic airbrushed skin shading with glossy highlights. Big head, short stocky body (about 2.5 heads tall). Thin brown-black ink linework, saturated colors, clean edges. Korean setting, Korean people unless stated otherwise. No text, no letters, no numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signature.

This is one complete illustrated scene for an explainer video, composed like a single manga panel.

Match the art style of the first attached image exactly: same line weight, same skin shading, same color saturation, same level of exaggeration.

Attached image 2 shows the dad: draw this person with exactly the same face, hairstyle, hair color, clothes, colors and body shape.

Also in the picture: the dad: a Korean father in his late 30s, slightly chubby with a round face, short black hair that is clearly thinning on top, thick eyebrows, faint stubble, wearing a mustard-yellow knit cardigan over a white t-shirt, gray sweatpants and house slippers; a kind but easily flustered look.

Inside a subway car, the dad is frozen in mid-air in a heroic slow-motion dive toward a single empty seat, body twisting like an Olympic gymnast, arms stretched forward, briefcase flying behind him, cheeks flapping, eyes blazing with determination, motion lines and sparkles around him. Standing passengers around are plain flat grey silhouettes with no faces, all turning to look. The dad stays in the exact gag-manga cartoon style of the attached images. Absolutely no readable words, letters, numbers, route numbers, station names or logos anywhere; no caption boxes, no speech bubbles, no frame border.

The camera will slowly pan and zoom across this picture, so paint about 8% extra scenery at every edge and keep nothing important within that margin.

Keep the main subject in the middle and leave the top-left corner calm (a caption is added there later). All signs and labels are blank shapes with no text. 16:9 landscape, highest resolution.

Also in the picture: the kid: an 8-year-old Korean child with a black bowl-cut, huge round curious eyes, one missing front tooth, wearing a red hoodie, navy shorts and white socks; small, fearless and very direct.

Inside a subway car: the dad sits smugly with legs crossed, his brown briefcase placed proudly on the empty seat next to him with a little sparkle, one hand patting the bag. His young son stands beside him holding a hand strap and looking up at him with a flat unimpressed face. A plain flat grey silhouette of an elderly man with a cane stands nearby. Both family members stay in the exact gag-manga cartoon style of the attached images. Absolutely no readable words, letters, numbers, route numbers, station names or logos anywhere; no caption boxes, no speech bubbles, no frame border. Other passengers are drawn ONLY as plain flat grey silhouettes with no faces.

Also in the picture: the grandma: a small, round Korean grandmother in her late seventies, short permed silver hair, rosy cheeks, kind crescent-moon eyes behind small round glasses, a soft warm smile; wearing a floral-print cardigan over a plain lilac blouse, comfy gray pants; absolutely NO text and NO logos; warm and gentle.

Inside a subway car: the dad sits on a bench seat with his eyes squeezed tightly shut and his head tilted back, a fake bubble of drool, but one eye is secretly peeking open a tiny slit, a big sweat drop on his temple. Directly in front of him the small grandma stands holding a hand strap with a tired gentle face, one hand on her aching knee. Both stay in the exact gag-manga cartoon style of the attached images. Absolutely no readable words, letters, numbers, route numbers, station names or logos anywhere; no caption boxes, no speech bubbles, no frame border.

The camera will slowly pan and zoom across this picture, so paint about 8% extra scenery at every edge and keep nothing important within that margin.

Keep the main subject in the middle and leave the top-left corner calm (a caption is added there later). All signs and labels are blank shapes with no text. 16:9 landscape, highest resolution.

Japanese gag-manga sticker illustration style. Grotesquely exaggerated comedic expressions, huge open mouths with detailed teeth and gums, bulging eyes, sweat drops, wrinkles. Semi-realistic airbrushed skin shading with glossy highlights. Big head, short stocky body (about 2.5 heads tall). Thin brown-black ink linework, saturated colors, clean edges. Korean setting, Korean people unless stated otherwise. No text, no letters, no numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signature.

This is one complete illustrated scene for an explainer video, composed like a single manga panel.

Match the art style of the first attached image exactly: same line weight, same skin shading, same color saturation, same level of exaggeration.

Attached image 2 shows the dad: draw this person with exactly the same face, hairstyle, hair color, clothes, colors and body shape.

Inside a subway car with the doors just closing in the background: the dad suddenly wide awake, eyes wide open and sparkling, stretching both arms up with a huge refreshed grin as if it were a miracle, holy light rays and sparkles bursting behind him like a church window. The dad stays in the exact gag-manga cartoon style of the attached images. Absolutely no readable words, letters, numbers, route numbers, station names or logos anywhere; no caption boxes, no speech bubbles, no frame border.

Inside a subway car: the dad stands holding a smartphone to his ear, mouth wide open shouting cheerfully, bowing repeatedly as if talking to his boss, huge comic sound-wave rings spreading out from his mouth across the whole car. Every other passenger in the car is a plain flat grey silhouette with no face, and all of them have turned their heads toward him at the same time.

Also in the picture: the bus driver: the IDENTICAL TWIN sister of the station attendant — exactly the same face, same low bun of black hair, same straight eyebrows and composed narrow eyes; wearing a light sky-blue bus driver uniform shirt with a navy tie and white gloves; absolutely NO text, NO letters, NO name tags, NO badges and NO logos anywhere; perfectly polite, completely deadpan.

At the front door of a city bus, seen from inside: the dad has one foot on the bus step, happily holding a big take-out iced coffee cup with a straw and ice, mid-sip. From the driver seat the bus driver holds out one white-gloved hand with the palm toward him in a firm polite STOP gesture, perfectly deadpan.

At a sunny bus stop: the dad tilts his head all the way back chugging a big take-out iced coffee in one go, ice cubes tumbling, then clutching his forehead with his free hand, eyes crossed and watering, a comic blue ice-cold shiver effect and little ice crystals around his head (brain freeze).

Inside a city bus at night: the exhausted dad is fast asleep sprawled across the seat, legs spread wide taking up two seats, a huge hiking backpack still on his back poking into the aisle, an iced coffee cup tilting in one hand, his smartphone in the other hand playing a loud video with comic music notes and sound waves coming out, mouth wide open snoring with a big snot bubble and floating Z letters.

Japanese gag-manga sticker illustration style. A single object sticker: no human, no face unless the description below asks for one. Semi-realistic airbrushed shading with glossy highlights. Thin brown-black ink linework, saturated colors, clean edges. No text, no letters, no numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signature.

This is a single object cutout for a 2D animated video: bold readable shape, clear colors with soft shading, no people unless stated.

Match the drawing style of the first attached image (line weight, shading, color saturation) but draw a completely NEW object as described below. Do not copy, edit or reuse the attached object.

A single slightly worn brown leather briefcase with a small sparkle, as if proudly reserving a seat. No logos, no text.

The cutout will be animated (popping in, swaying, sliding across the screen), so keep it as one compact connected shape with a clean outline and no loose parts floating apart from it.

The whole subject visible with a small empty margin on every side, not cropped, centered.

Solid flat pure green (#00FF00) background filling everything around the subject: no floor, no cast shadow, no gradient, no scenery, no effects or objects outside the subject.
