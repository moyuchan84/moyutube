# Gemini 프롬프트 — 모 아니면 도 ① 캠핑 vs 집콕 (갈림길 · 모 결말 · 도 결말 공용)

> `video/scripts/prompts.mjs` 가 만든 파일이다. 직접 고치지 말고 `content/md01-camping/script/art.json` 을 고친 뒤 `npm run prompts` 를 다시 실행한다.
> 이 편에만 쓰는 그림 24장. 진행: 0 / 24
> 다 넣었으면 `video/` 에서 `npm run make -- md01` → `video/out/md01/md01.mp4`

## 사용법

1. 위에서부터 **차례대로** 한 블록씩 Gemini에 붙여넣는다. 화풍 문장은 블록마다 이미 들어 있다.
2. 블록의 **첨부** 이미지를 **빠짐없이, 적힌 순서대로** 같이 올린다 (프롬프트가 "attached image 2" 처럼 번호로 부른다). 첨부 목록은 `art-lib.mjs` 의 `attachPlan` 이 정한다 — 손으로 빼거나 바꾸지 않는다. 첨부가 하나라도 실패하면 글자만 보내지 말고 멈춘다. 규칙 전체는 `qna/ART_GUIDE.md`.
   ⚠️ 줄이 있는 블록은 기준 그림이 빠졌거나 아직 없는 것이다 — 그것부터 고친다.
3. 결과는 **저장** 경로와 이름 그대로 넣는다. 배경 제거·자르기·크기 조절은 하지 않는다 (`npm run art` 가 한다).
4. 한 사람은 **한 대화창**에서 끝내고, 다음 사람·배경은 새 대화창에서 시작한다. 대화가 길어지면 화풍이 흐려진다.
5. 글자는 그리지 않는다. 자막·간판·연도는 영상 코드가 얹는다.
6. 제목 옆 ✅ 는 이미 파일이 있다는 뜻이다 (`npm run prompts` 를 다시 돌리면 갱신된다).
7. **말하는 그림**(이름이 `-b` 로 끝나는 것)은 첫 번째 프레임을 ②로 첨부해 "입만 바꿔 다시 그리기"로 만든다. 두 장의 크기와 자리가 같아야 입만 움직여 보인다.

### 다시 뽑을 때 이어서 보내는 문장

| 문제 | 문장 |
|---|---|
| 배경이 단색 초록이 아님 | `Redo it with a perfectly flat pure green #00FF00 background, no shadow, no floor.` |
| 몸이 잘림 | `Zoom out so the whole body fits with empty margin on every side.` |
| 다른 사람처럼 나옴 | `Keep the exact same face, hair and clothes as attached image 2. Only change the pose.` |
| 글자가 들어감 | `Remove all text and letters; leave signs blank.` |
| 화풍이 순해짐 | `More grotesque gag-manga exaggeration, like the first attached image: bigger mouth, bulging eyes, more sweat.` |
| 배경에 사람이 있음 | `Remove every person. Background only.` |
| 말하는 그림의 몸이 달라짐 | `Too different. Copy attached image 2 exactly and change only the mouth.` |
| 무대 장면에 주인공이 있음 | `Remove the main character and leave that spot empty; it is added later as a separate cutout.` |

## 1. 아직 없는 그림 — 24장 (이것만 Gemini 에서 만든다)

#### 1. 캠핑장 사장님 — 전화 받으며 태평하게 웃음
- 저장: `content/md01-camping/art/campowner/normal.png`
- 첨부 1장 (빠짐없이, 이 순서로): ① `content/_common/art/anchor/style-cutin.png` (화풍 앵커)
- 종류 · 비율: 캐릭터 (전신, 초록 배경) · 2:3 세로
- 쓰이는 컷: c13 · 모 c01
- 메모: 사장님 기준 그림. 이것부터 뽑는다.

```text
Japanese gag-manga sticker illustration style. Grotesquely exaggerated comedic expressions, huge open mouths with detailed teeth and gums, bulging eyes, sweat drops, wrinkles. Semi-realistic airbrushed skin shading with glossy highlights. Big head, short stocky body (about 2.5 heads tall). Thin brown-black ink linework, saturated colors, clean edges. Korean setting, Korean people unless stated otherwise. No text, no letters, no numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signature.

This is a character cutout for a 2D animated video: bold readable silhouette, oversized head and face, clear colors with soft shading.

Match the art style of the first attached image exactly: same line weight, same skin shading, same color saturation, same level of exaggeration.

Character: the campsite owner: a Korean man in his late fifties with a deep sun tan, a round cheerful face with crinkly laughing eyes, a short gray buzz cut, a towel draped around his neck; wearing a faded olive fishing vest over a white T-shirt, knee-length shorts and rubber rain boots; absolutely NO text, NO letters and NO logos anywhere; relaxed and sunny even when delivering bad news.

3/4 view turned slightly to the LEFT. Standing relaxed, holding a plain black smartphone to his ear with one hand and giving a cheerful thumbs-up with the other, a huge sunny grin, totally unbothered. His rubber boots are wet and muddy.

Comic effect marks (sweat drops, shock lines, sparkles) may surround the character but must stay close to the body.

The cutout will be animated (hopping, tilting, sliding across the screen), so draw one clear, strongly readable pose with the arms and anything held kept away from the torso, both feet on the same ground line, and nothing cropped.

Full body, the entire character visible from head to toe with a small empty margin on every side, not cropped, centered. Portrait 2:3 aspect ratio.

Solid flat pure green (#00FF00) background filling everything around the subject: no floor, no cast shadow, no gradient, no scenery, no effects or objects outside the subject.

Korean setting, Korean people unless stated otherwise. No text, no letters, no numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signature.

This is one complete illustrated scene for an explainer video, composed like a single manga panel.

Match the art style of the first attached image exactly: same line weight, same skin shading, same color saturation, same level of exaggeration.

Attached image 2 shows the dad: draw this person with exactly the same face, hairstyle, hair color, clothes, colors and body shape.

Also in the picture: the dad: a Korean father in his late 30s, slightly chubby with a round face, short black hair that is clearly thinning on top, thick eyebrows, faint stubble, wearing a mustard-yellow knit cardigan over a white t-shirt, gray sweatpants and house slippers; a kind but easily flustered look.

A dim underground apartment parking garage at 4 a.m., cold fluorescent lights, concrete pillars. The dad, wearing a bright headlamp on his forehead and a camping vest, is pressing his whole backside against the open hatchback trunk of a small family SUV to force it shut, face straining with effort and determination. The trunk is absurdly overstuffed like a tetris game: folded camping chairs, a rolled tent, stacked firewood, a cooler, lanterns, a hammock, a cast-iron pan sticking out, a sleeping bag bursting out of the gap. A tower of seventeen plain brown delivery boxes, flattened and stacked, stands beside the car. All boxes completely blank, no writing, no logos, no license plate text.

The camera will slowly pan and zoom across this picture, so paint about 8% extra scenery at every edge and keep nothing important within that margin.

Keep the main subject in the middle and leave the top-left corner calm (a caption is added there later). All signs and labels are blank shapes with no text. 16:9 landscape, highest resolution.

Japanese gag-manga sticker illustration style. A single object sticker: no human, no face unless the description below asks for one. Semi-realistic airbrushed shading with glossy highlights. Thin brown-black ink linework, saturated colors, clean edges. No text, no letters, no numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signature.

This is a single object cutout for a 2D animated video: bold readable shape, clear colors with soft shading, no people unless stated.

Match the drawing style of the first attached image (line weight, shading, color saturation) but draw a completely NEW object as described below. Do not copy, edit or reuse the attached object.

Inside an open home freezer drawer frosted with ice: bags of frozen dumplings, and one long curled paper receipt peeking out from behind the dumpling bags, half covered in frost, glowing suspiciously. The receipt shows only faint gray horizontal lines, no readable text, no numbers. Dumpling bags completely plain, no writing, no logos.

The cutout will be animated (popping in, swaying, sliding across the screen), so keep it as one compact connected shape with a clean outline and no loose parts floating apart from it.

The whole subject visible with a small empty margin on every side, not cropped, centered.

Solid flat pure green (#00FF00) background filling everything around the subject: no floor, no cast shadow, no gradient, no scenery, no effects or objects outside the subject.

Also in the picture: the mom: a Korean mother in her late 30s, slim with a soft oval face and a fair complexion, a shoulder-length dark brown bob with a side part, one side tucked behind her ear and the ends curling slightly inward, thin silver round wire-frame glasses, calm almond-shaped eyes, wearing a sage-green crew-neck knit sweater, beige wide-leg pants and house slippers; calm, sharp and quietly amused, the one who usually already knows the answer.

Also in the picture: the kid: an 8-year-old Korean child with a black bowl-cut, huge round curious eyes, one missing front tooth, wearing a red hoodie, navy shorts and white socks; small, fearless and very direct.

Inside a small family car on a gray morning, seen from the front through the windshield like a sitcom shot. The dad drives with both hands gripping the wheel, sweating nervously, eyes darting sideways. The mom in the passenger seat sits stiffly with a big blue cooler box on her lap up to her chin, staring flatly at the dad. In the back seat, the kid sits awkwardly on top of a pile of firewood logs, holding three camping lanterns on his lap, with a rolled sleeping mat and a folded camping chair squeezed around him, his head touching the roof. Absolutely no text, no logos.

The camera will slowly pan and zoom across this picture, so paint about 8% extra scenery at every edge and keep nothing important within that margin.

Keep the main subject in the middle and leave the top-left corner calm (a caption is added there later). All signs and labels are blank shapes with no text. 16:9 landscape, highest resolution.

A dreamy imagination scene with soft pastel glow and floating sparkles: the mom lies perfectly horizontal on a big soft living-room sofa under a fluffy blanket, eyes closed in pure bliss, a heavenly golden halo of light around her, a cup of tea on the side table, a remote control resting on her stomach. Soft clouds frame the edges like a daydream bubble. Absolutely no text.

This is a character cutout for a 2D animated video: bold readable silhouette, oversized head and face, clear colors with soft shading.

Match the art style of the first attached image exactly: same line weight, same skin shading, same color saturation, same level of exaggeration.

The character must be exactly the same person as in attached image 2: same face, hairstyle, hair color, clothes, colors and body shape. Only the pose and expression change.

Character: the dad: a Korean father in his late 30s, slightly chubby with a round face, short black hair that is clearly thinning on top, thick eyebrows, faint stubble, wearing a mustard-yellow knit cardigan over a white t-shirt, gray sweatpants and house slippers; a kind but easily flustered look.

3/4 view turned slightly to the RIGHT. Holding a big open camping-gear catalog spread wide toward the viewer with both hands, eyes sparkling like stars, a huge eager grin, leaning forward excitedly. The catalog pages show only simple drawings of tents and lanterns, no text.

Comic effect marks (sweat drops, shock lines, sparkles) may surround the character but must stay close to the body.

The cutout will be animated (hopping, tilting, sliding across the screen), so draw one clear, strongly readable pose with the arms and anything held kept away from the torso, both feet on the same ground line, and nothing cropped.

Full body, the entire character visible from head to toe with a small empty margin on every side, not cropped, centered. Portrait 2:3 aspect ratio.

Solid flat pure green (#00FF00) background filling everything around the subject: no floor, no cast shadow, no gradient, no scenery, no effects or objects outside the subject.

Front view. Spreading both arms wide open to the sides like presenting the whole world, chin raised, eyes closed with a serene, proud, almost spiritual smile, a few leaves and a little bird floating around him for comic effect.

A car dashboard navigation screen, front view, filling the frame: a simple map with one road splitting into a fork, one branch going left toward a little green tent icon, the other going right toward a little house icon. In the top corner of the screen, a small flat cartoon face icon with half-closed bored eyes and a perfectly straight line mouth, totally deadpan. Absolutely no text, no numbers, no letters.

Korean setting, Korean people unless stated otherwise. No text, no letters, no numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signature.

Background art only, absolutely no people and no characters. A flat, straight-on stage-like view (like a sitcom set), camera at chest height, no extreme perspective.

Match the art style of the first attached image exactly: same line weight, same skin shading, same color saturation, same level of exaggeration.

A Korean highway seen from the driver's seat level on an overcast morning, the road splitting into two at a dramatic fork: the left lane curves toward distant green mountains with dark rain clouds over them, the right lane curves toward a cluster of apartment buildings under a soft clear sky. A big green overhead highway sign board with two arrows, the sign panels completely blank with no text. Cinematic, symmetrical composition.

The camera will slowly pan and zoom across this picture, so paint about 8% extra scenery at every edge and keep nothing important within that margin.

Keep the bottom third of the picture an open, uncluttered floor: characters will be placed there later. All signs, posters, screens and labels are blank shapes with no text. 16:9 landscape, highest resolution.

A small forest campsite plot completely flooded into a muddy pond after rain, a wooden site marker post sticking out of the water with a blank sign, a picnic table half submerged, rain puddles rippling, dozens of cheerful little green frogs sitting on the table, the post and lily-pad-like leaves, some jumping. Pine trees around, wet gray sky starting to clear. The site marker is blank, absolutely no text.

Also in the picture: the mom: a Korean mother in her late 30s, slim with a soft oval face and a fair complexion, a shoulder-length dark brown bob with a side part, one side tucked behind her ear and the ends curling slightly inward, thin silver round wire-frame glasses, calm almond-shaped eyes, wearing a sage-green crew-neck knit sweater, beige wide-leg pants and house slippers; calm, sharp and quietly amused, the one who usually already knows the answer.

Also in the picture: the kid: an 8-year-old Korean child with a black bowl-cut, huge round curious eyes, one missing front tooth, wearing a red hoodie, navy shorts and white socks; small, fearless and very direct.

A small Korean highway rest area with a parked family SUV, its hatchback trunk flung open and an enormous avalanche of camping gear exploding out of it onto the asphalt: folding chairs, a tent bag, firewood, lanterns, a cooler, a hammock, pans, sleeping bags, piled into a small mountain. The dad is buried in the pile with only his head and one raised arm sticking out of the top, his hand triumphantly holding up four traditional wooden yut sticks. The mom stands beside the car with arms crossed and a flat unimpressed face, the kid peeks out from the back seat window, delighted. Absolutely no text, no logos, no license plate text.

The camera will slowly pan and zoom across this picture, so paint about 8% extra scenery at every edge and keep nothing important within that margin.

Keep the main subject in the middle and leave the top-left corner calm (a caption is added there later). All signs and labels are blank shapes with no text. 16:9 landscape, highest resolution.

Japanese gag-manga sticker illustration style. Grotesquely exaggerated comedic expressions, huge open mouths with detailed teeth and gums, bulging eyes, sweat drops, wrinkles. Semi-realistic airbrushed skin shading with glossy highlights. Big head, short stocky body (about 2.5 heads tall). Thin brown-black ink linework, saturated colors, clean edges. Korean setting, Korean people unless stated otherwise. No text, no letters, no numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signature.

This is a character cutout for a 2D animated video: bold readable silhouette, oversized head and face, clear colors with soft shading.

Match the art style of the first attached image exactly: same line weight, same skin shading, same color saturation, same level of exaggeration.

The character must be exactly the same person as in attached image 2: same face, hairstyle, hair color, clothes, colors and body shape. Only the pose and expression change.

Character: the dad: a Korean father in his late 30s, slightly chubby with a round face, short black hair that is clearly thinning on top, thick eyebrows, faint stubble, wearing a mustard-yellow knit cardigan over a white t-shirt, gray sweatpants and house slippers; a kind but easily flustered look.

Dynamic low-angle 3/4 view. Throwing four traditional Korean wooden yut sticks high up into the air with one arm stretched upward, the other fist clenched, legs in a wide heroic stance, eyes blazing with fierce determination, mouth wide open shouting, hair blown back. The four yut sticks are spinning in the air above his hand.

Comic effect marks (sweat drops, shock lines, sparkles) may surround the character but must stay close to the body.

The cutout will be animated (hopping, tilting, sliding across the screen), so draw one clear, strongly readable pose with the arms and anything held kept away from the torso, both feet on the same ground line, and nothing cropped.

Full body, the entire character visible from head to toe with a small empty margin on every side, not cropped, centered. Portrait 2:3 aspect ratio.

Solid flat pure green (#00FF00) background filling everything around the subject: no floor, no cast shadow, no gradient, no scenery, no effects or objects outside the subject.

The flooded forest campsite pond in the afternoon: a dome tent sits on top of a big inflatable air mattress floating in the middle of the muddy water like a little houseboat, tied to a tree with a rope. The dad stands proudly on the edge of the floating mattress, soaking wet up to his knees, both fists on his hips, chest puffed out, beaming. Frogs sit on the tent roof. Absolutely no text.

Dusk at a wet campsite: the dad crouches over a camping grill full of soggy black charcoal that only puffs a sad little smoke, holding a huge pile of raw pork belly on a tray. A thick cloud of cartoon mosquitoes swarms around the family, some mosquitoes lined up in an orderly queue in the air as if waiting at a buffet, one wearing a tiny napkin.

Japanese gag-manga sticker illustration style. A single object sticker: no human, no face unless the description below asks for one. Semi-realistic airbrushed shading with glossy highlights. Thin brown-black ink linework, saturated colors, clean edges. No text, no letters, no numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signature.

This is a single object cutout for a 2D animated video: bold readable shape, clear colors with soft shading, no people unless stated.

Match the drawing style of the first attached image (line weight, shading, color saturation) but draw a completely NEW object as described below. Do not copy, edit or reuse the attached object.

A plain black smartphone, front view, the screen showing a simple weather display: a huge bright smiling cartoon sun with sunglasses on a clear blue sky, a tiny tent icon below. Absolutely no text, no numbers.

The cutout will be animated (popping in, swaying, sliding across the screen), so keep it as one compact connected shape with a clean outline and no loose parts floating apart from it.

The whole subject visible with a small empty margin on every side, not cropped, centered.

Solid flat pure green (#00FF00) background filling everything around the subject: no floor, no cast shadow, no gradient, no scenery, no effects or objects outside the subject.

Japanese gag-manga sticker illustration style. Grotesquely exaggerated comedic expressions, huge open mouths with detailed teeth and gums, bulging eyes, sweat drops, wrinkles. Semi-realistic airbrushed skin shading with glossy highlights. Big head, short stocky body (about 2.5 heads tall). Thin brown-black ink linework, saturated colors, clean edges. Korean setting, Korean people unless stated otherwise. No text, no letters, no numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signature.

This is a character cutout for a 2D animated video: bold readable silhouette, oversized head and face, clear colors with soft shading.

Match the art style of the first attached image exactly: same line weight, same skin shading, same color saturation, same level of exaggeration.

The character must be exactly the same person as in attached image 2: same face, hairstyle, hair color, clothes, colors and body shape. Only the pose and expression change.

Character: the dad: a Korean father in his late 30s, slightly chubby with a round face, short black hair that is clearly thinning on top, thick eyebrows, faint stubble, wearing a mustard-yellow knit cardigan over a white t-shirt, gray sweatpants and house slippers; a kind but easily flustered look.

3/4 view turned slightly to the LEFT. On his knees with both arms raised to the sky, head thrown back, mouth wide open wailing, comical waterfall tears streaming from both eyes, holding a smartphone in one hand.

Comic effect marks (sweat drops, shock lines, sparkles) may surround the character but must stay close to the body.

The cutout will be animated (hopping, tilting, sliding across the screen), so draw one clear, strongly readable pose with the arms and anything held kept away from the torso, both feet on the same ground line, and nothing cropped.

Full body, the entire character visible from head to toe with a small empty margin on every side, not cropped, centered. Portrait 2:3 aspect ratio.

Solid flat pure green (#00FF00) background filling everything around the subject: no floor, no cast shadow, no gradient, no scenery, no effects or objects outside the subject.

Japanese gag-manga sticker illustration style. A single object sticker: no human, no face unless the description below asks for one. Semi-realistic airbrushed shading with glossy highlights. Thin brown-black ink linework, saturated colors, clean edges. No text, no letters, no numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signature.

This is a single object cutout for a 2D animated video: bold readable shape, clear colors with soft shading, no people unless stated.

Match the drawing style of the first attached image (line weight, shading, color saturation) but draw a completely NEW object as described below. Do not copy, edit or reuse the attached object.

A plain black smartphone, front view, lying on a table, the screen lit with a single notification card showing a little credit card icon, a calendar icon and a row of twelve small circles with only the first circle filled in. A small cartoon 'ding' sparkle. Absolutely no text, no numbers, no letters.

The cutout will be animated (popping in, swaying, sliding across the screen), so keep it as one compact connected shape with a clean outline and no loose parts floating apart from it.

The whole subject visible with a small empty margin on every side, not cropped, centered.

Solid flat pure green (#00FF00) background filling everything around the subject: no floor, no cast shadow, no gradient, no scenery, no effects or objects outside the subject.
