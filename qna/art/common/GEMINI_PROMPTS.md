# Gemini 프롬프트 — 공통 — 가족 캐릭터 · 집 배경

> `video/scripts/prompts.mjs` 가 만든 파일이다. 직접 고치지 말고 `video/src/art-common.json` 을 고친 뒤 `npm run prompts` 를 다시 실행한다.
> 모든 편이 같이 쓰는 그림이다. **한 번만 만들면 된다.** 진행: 30 / 31

## 사용법

1. 위에서부터 **차례대로** 한 블록씩 Gemini에 붙여넣는다. 화풍 문장은 블록마다 이미 들어 있다.
2. 블록의 **첨부** 이미지를 같이 올린다. ①은 화풍 고정용 앵커, ②는 같은 사람 유지용 기준 그림이다 (순서 중요).
3. 결과는 **저장** 경로와 이름 그대로 넣는다. 배경 제거·자르기·크기 조절은 하지 않는다 (`npm run art` 가 한다).
4. 한 사람은 **한 대화창**에서 끝내고, 다음 사람·배경은 새 대화창에서 시작한다. 대화가 길어지면 화풍이 흐려진다.
5. 글자는 그리지 않는다. 자막·간판·연도는 영상 코드가 얹는다.
6. 제목 옆 ✅ 는 이미 파일이 있다는 뜻이다 (`npm run prompts` 를 다시 돌리면 갱신된다).
7. **말하는 그림**(이름이 `-b` 로 끝나는 것)은 첫 번째 프레임을 ②로 첨부해 "입만 바꿔 다시 그리기"로 만든다. 두 장의 크기와 자리가 같아야 입만 움직여 보인다.

### 다시 뽑을 때 이어서 보내는 문장

| 문제 | 문장 |
|---|---|
| 배경이 단색 초록이 아님 | `Redo it with a perfectly flat pure green #00FF00 background, no shadow, no floor.` |
| 몸이 잘림 | `Zoom out so the whole body fits with empty margin on every side.` |
| 다른 사람처럼 나옴 | `Keep the exact same face, hair and clothes as attached image 2. Only change the pose.` |
| 글자가 들어감 | `Remove all text and letters; leave signs blank.` |
| 화풍이 순해짐 | `More grotesque gag-manga exaggeration, like the first attached image: bigger mouth, bulging eyes, more sweat.` |
| 배경에 사람이 있음 | `Remove every person. Background only.` |
| 말하는 그림의 몸이 달라짐 | `Too different. Copy attached image 2 exactly and change only the mouth.` |
| 무대 장면에 주인공이 있음 | `Remove the main character and leave that spot empty; it is added later as a separate cutout.` |

Japanese gag-manga sticker illustration style. Grotesquely exaggerated comedic expressions, huge open mouths with detailed teeth and gums, bulging eyes, sweat drops, wrinkles. Semi-realistic airbrushed skin shading with glossy highlights. Big head, short stocky body (about 2.5 heads tall). Thin brown-black ink linework, saturated colors, clean edges. Korean setting, Korean people unless stated otherwise. No text, no letters, no numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signature.

This is a character cutout for a 2D animated video: bold readable silhouette, oversized head and face, clear colors with soft shading.

Match the art style of the first attached image exactly: same line weight, same skin shading, same color saturation, same level of exaggeration.

Character: the dad: a Korean father in his late 30s, slightly chubby with a round face, short black hair that is clearly thinning on top, thick eyebrows, faint stubble, wearing a mustard-yellow knit cardigan over a white t-shirt, gray sweatpants and house slippers; a kind but easily flustered look.

3/4 view, body and face turned slightly to the LEFT. Standing relaxed, arms at his sides, a mild friendly smile.

Comic effect marks (sweat drops, shock lines, sparkles) may surround the character but must stay close to the body.

The cutout will be animated (hopping, tilting, sliding across the screen), so draw one clear, strongly readable pose with the arms and anything held kept away from the torso, both feet on the same ground line, and nothing cropped.

Full body, the entire character visible from head to toe with a small empty margin on every side, not cropped, centered. Portrait 2:3 aspect ratio.

Solid flat pure green (#00FF00) background filling everything around the subject: no floor, no cast shadow, no gradient, no scenery, no effects or objects outside the subject.

3/4 view turned slightly to the LEFT. He has just been asked a question he cannot answer: eyes darting sideways, forced crooked smile showing teeth, one hand rubbing the back of his neck, cold sweat drops flying off his forehead, knees slightly bent.

3/4 view turned slightly to the LEFT. Sneaking a search at night: hunched over and tiptoeing, holding a smartphone close to his face with both hands, the screen glow lighting his face from below, eyes wide and bloodshot, lips pressed tight, glancing nervously over his shoulder, cold sweat drops.

This is a character cutout for a 2D animated video.

Match the art style of the first attached image exactly: same line weight, same skin shading, same color saturation, same level of exaggeration.

This is the SECOND FRAME of a two-frame animation. Redraw attached image 2 EXACTLY: same character, same pose, same size, same position in the frame, same clothes, same colors, same line work, same framing and margins. Change ONLY what is described below. Everything else must be pixel-for-pixel as close to attached image 2 as possible so the two frames can be flipped back and forth.

Character: the dad: a Korean father in his late 30s, slightly chubby with a round face, short black hair that is clearly thinning on top, thick eyebrows, faint stubble, wearing a mustard-yellow knit cardigan over a white t-shirt, gray sweatpants and house slippers; a kind but easily flustered look.

Change only the face and the raised hand: the mouth is now closed in a confident smile (as if between two words) and the raised index finger is tilted a few degrees forward.

Same aspect ratio, framing and margins as attached image 2.

Japanese gag-manga sticker illustration style. Grotesquely exaggerated comedic expressions, huge open mouths with detailed teeth and gums, bulging eyes, sweat drops, wrinkles. Semi-realistic airbrushed skin shading with glossy highlights. Big head, short stocky body (about 2.5 heads tall). Thin brown-black ink linework, saturated colors, clean edges. Korean setting, Korean people unless stated otherwise. No text, no letters, no numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signature.

This is a character cutout for a 2D animated video.

Match the art style of the first attached image exactly: same line weight, same skin shading, same color saturation, same level of exaggeration.

This is the SECOND FRAME of a two-frame animation. Redraw attached image 2 EXACTLY: same character, same pose, same size, same position in the frame, same clothes, same colors, same line work, same framing and margins. Change ONLY what is described below. Everything else must be pixel-for-pixel as close to attached image 2 as possible so the two frames can be flipped back and forth.

Character: the kid: an 8-year-old Korean child with a black bowl-cut, huge round curious eyes, one missing front tooth, wearing a red hoodie, navy shorts and white socks; small, fearless and very direct.

Change only the face: the mouth is now closed in a small pouty line (as if between two words) and the eyebrows are a little lower. The pointing arm stays exactly where it is.

Same aspect ratio, framing and margins as attached image 2.

Solid flat pure green (#00FF00) background filling everything around the subject: no floor, no cast shadow, no gradient, no scenery, no effects or objects outside the subject.

Korean setting, Korean people unless stated otherwise. No text, no letters, no numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signature.

This is a character cutout for a 2D animated video: bold readable silhouette, oversized head and face, clear colors with soft shading.

Match the art style of the first attached image exactly: same line weight, same skin shading, same color saturation, same level of exaggeration.

Character: the mom: a Korean mother in her late 30s, slim with a soft oval face and a fair complexion, a shoulder-length dark brown bob with a side part, one side tucked behind her ear and the ends curling slightly inward, thin silver round wire-frame glasses, calm almond-shaped eyes, wearing a sage-green crew-neck knit sweater, beige wide-leg pants and house slippers; calm, sharp and quietly amused, the one who usually already knows the answer.

The mom must be exactly the same woman as the woman with round glasses in attached images 2 and 3 (the channel profile picture and banner): same face, glasses, hairstyle, hair color and sage-green sweater. Draw only her, alone, as a full-body character; ignore the other people in those images. 3/4 view, body and face turned slightly to the LEFT. Standing relaxed, hands loosely clasped in front, a calm gentle smile.

Comic effect marks (sweat drops, shock lines, sparkles) may surround the character but must stay close to the body.

The cutout will be animated (hopping, tilting, sliding across the screen), so draw one clear, strongly readable pose with the arms and anything held kept away from the torso, both feet on the same ground line, and nothing cropped.

Full body, the entire character visible from head to toe with a small empty margin on every side, not cropped, centered. Portrait 2:3 aspect ratio.

Solid flat pure green (#00FF00) background filling everything around the subject: no floor, no cast shadow, no gradient, no scenery, no effects or objects outside the subject.

Facing slightly to the LEFT. Total panic: eyes bulging and looking away, clenched-teeth fake smile, cold sweat pouring down the whole face, a vein on the temple, trembling.

Comic effect marks (sweat drops, shock lines, sparkles) may surround the character but must stay close to the body.

Chest-up close-up, the face fills most of the frame, centered, not cropped. Square 1:1 aspect ratio.

Solid flat pure green (#00FF00) background filling everything around the subject: no floor, no cast shadow, no gradient, no scenery, no effects or objects outside the subject.

Japanese gag-manga sticker illustration style. Grotesquely exaggerated comedic expressions, huge open mouths with detailed teeth and gums, bulging eyes, sweat drops, wrinkles. Semi-realistic airbrushed skin shading with glossy highlights. Big head, short stocky body (about 2.5 heads tall). Thin brown-black ink linework, saturated colors, clean edges. Korean setting, Korean people unless stated otherwise. No text, no letters, no numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signature.

This is a large close-up reaction shot for a comedy video: maximum facial detail, extreme exaggeration, dramatic lighting on the face.

Match the art style of the first attached image exactly: same line weight, same skin shading, same color saturation, same level of exaggeration.

The character must be exactly the same person as in attached image 2: same face, hairstyle, hair color, clothes, colors and body shape. Only the pose and expression change.

Facing slightly to the LEFT. Utterly done: dead flat stare through her glasses, mouth a straight line, a vein on the temple, a dark gloomy shadow over the upper half of the face, a big sigh cloud.

Japanese gag-manga sticker illustration style. Grotesquely exaggerated comedic expressions, huge open mouths with detailed teeth and gums, bulging eyes, sweat drops, wrinkles. Semi-realistic airbrushed skin shading with glossy highlights. Big head, short stocky body (about 2.5 heads tall). Thin brown-black ink linework, saturated colors, clean edges. Korean setting, Korean people unless stated otherwise. No text, no letters, no numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signature.

Background art only, absolutely no people and no characters. A flat, straight-on stage-like view (like a sitcom set), camera at chest height, no extreme perspective.

Match the art style of the first attached image exactly: same line weight, same skin shading, same color saturation, same level of exaggeration.

A cozy Korean apartment living room in the daytime: beige fabric sofa against the back wall, a low wooden table, a tall leafy plant, a window with light curtains, a few picture frames with blank contents, light wooden floor.

The camera will slowly pan and zoom across this picture, so paint about 8% extra scenery at every edge and keep nothing important within that margin.

Keep the bottom third of the picture an open, uncluttered floor: characters will be placed there later. All signs, posters, screens and labels are blank shapes with no text. 16:9 landscape, highest resolution.

The dining area of a cozy Korean apartment in the evening: a wooden dining table against the back wall set for dinner with rice bowls, soup, side dishes, spoons and chopsticks, three chairs, a warm pendant lamp hanging above the table, a rice cooker on a side shelf, a kitchen doorway on the right, light wooden floor.

A small Korean child's bedroom at night: a single bed with a star-pattern blanket against the back wall on the left, a bedside table with a warm glowing desk lamp, a window showing a crescent moon, dim blue room light with one warm pool of lamp light.
