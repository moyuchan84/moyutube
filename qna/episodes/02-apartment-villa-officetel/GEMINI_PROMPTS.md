# Gemini 프롬프트 — 2편 · 아파트 · 빌라 · 오피스텔, 뭐가 달라요?

> `video/scripts/prompts.mjs` 가 만든 파일이다. 직접 고치지 말고 `video/src/ep02/art.json` 을 고친 뒤 `npm run prompts` 를 다시 실행한다.
> 이 편에만 쓰는 그림 11장. 진행: 11 / 11
> 다 넣었으면 `video/` 에서 `npm run make -- ep02` → `video/out/ep02/ep02.mp4`

## 사용법

1. 위에서부터 **차례대로** 한 블록씩 Gemini에 붙여넣는다. 화풍 문장은 블록마다 이미 들어 있다.
2. 블록의 **첨부** 이미지를 같이 올린다. ①은 화풍 고정용 앵커, ②는 같은 사람 유지용 기준 그림이다 (순서 중요).
3. 결과는 **저장** 경로와 이름 그대로 넣는다. 배경 제거·자르기·크기 조절은 하지 않는다 (`npm run art` 가 한다).
4. 한 사람은 **한 대화창**에서 끝내고, 다음 사람·배경은 새 대화창에서 시작한다. 대화가 길어지면 화풍이 흐려진다.
5. 글자는 그리지 않는다. 자막·간판·연도는 영상 코드가 얹는다.
6. 제목 옆 ✅ 는 이미 파일이 있다는 뜻이다 (`npm run prompts` 를 다시 돌리면 갱신된다).
7. **말하는 그림**(이름이 `-b` 로 끝나는 것)은 첫 번째 프레임을 ②로 첨부해 "입만 바꿔 다시 그리기"로 만든다. 두 장의 크기와 자리가 같아야 입만 움직여 보인다.

### 다시 뽑을 때 이어서 보내는 문장

| 문제 | 문장 |
|---|---|
| 배경이 단색 초록이 아님 | `Redo it with a perfectly flat pure green #00FF00 background, no shadow, no floor.` |
| 몸이 잘림 | `Zoom out so the whole body fits with empty margin on every side.` |
| 다른 사람처럼 나옴 | `Keep the exact same face, hair and clothes as attached image 2. Only change the pose.` |
| 글자가 들어감 | `Remove all text and letters; leave signs blank.` |
| 화풍이 순해짐 | `More grotesque gag-manga exaggeration, like the first attached image: bigger mouth, bulging eyes, more sweat.` |
| 배경에 사람이 있음 | `Remove every person. Background only.` |
| 말하는 그림의 몸이 달라짐 | `Too different. Copy attached image 2 exactly and change only the mouth.` |
| 무대 장면에 주인공이 있음 | `Remove the main character and leave that spot empty; it is added later as a separate cutout.` |

## 1. 이 편의 그림

```text
Japanese gag-manga sticker illustration style. Grotesquely exaggerated comedic expressions, huge open mouths with detailed teeth and gums, bulging eyes, sweat drops, wrinkles. Semi-realistic airbrushed skin shading with glossy highlights. Big head, short stocky body (about 2.5 heads tall). Thin brown-black ink linework, saturated colors, clean edges. Korean setting, Korean people unless stated otherwise. No text, no letters, no numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signature.

This is one complete illustrated scene for an explainer video, composed like a single manga panel.

Match the art style of the first attached image exactly: same line weight, same skin shading, same color saturation, same level of exaggeration.

A dim study desk at night lit by one desk lamp. A gigantic, absurdly thick old law book lies open in the middle, its pages filled with rows of blank gray lines instead of writing. A huge magnifying glass hovers over one page, and inside the lens there is only an empty white gap between the lines where something should be listed. Loose pages fly up into the air, a cold cup of coffee and a pile of crumpled sticky notes sit beside the book. No people.

The camera will slowly pan and zoom across this picture, so paint about 8% extra scenery at every edge and keep nothing important within that margin.

Keep the main subject in the middle and leave the top-left corner calm (a caption is added there later). All signs and labels are blank shapes with no text. 16:9 landscape, highest resolution.

Seoul, 1962. Several brand-new plain six-storey concrete apartment blocks stand in a row on bare dirt ground, with small identical windows and laundry hanging from a few of them, low tiled-roof houses and hills far behind. In the foreground a small crowd of Korean people in early-1960s clothes (a man in a fedora and baggy suit, a grandmother in hanbok carrying a bundle on her head, a boy in a school cap) stand with their heads tilted all the way back and their mouths hanging open, gawking up at the buildings; one man's hat is falling off. Bright daytime.

The camera will slowly pan and zoom across this picture, so paint about 8% extra scenery at every edge and keep nothing important within that margin.

Keep the main subject in the middle and leave the top-left corner calm (a caption is added there later). All signs and labels are blank shapes with no text. 16:9 landscape, highest resolution.

A narrow Korean residential alley in the daytime. In the middle stands a red-brick multi-household building: the ground level is an open pilotis car park with only bare concrete pillars and two small cars squeezed under it, and exactly four residential floors with windows and small balconies stacked above it, so the whole building is five levels tall. Next to it a confused Korean delivery man on a scooter has stopped and is counting the floors on his fingers with a deeply puzzled face, sweat drops flying. Overhead power lines, potted plants by the entrance.

The camera will slowly pan and zoom across this picture, so paint about 8% extra scenery at every edge and keep nothing important within that margin.

Ancient Rome, a sunny countryside hill. A luxurious Roman country villa with white columns, a red terracotta tile roof, a courtyard fountain and cypress trees, vineyards rolling away behind it. In front, an extremely smug, chubby Roman aristocrat in a white toga and a laurel wreath lounges sideways on a couch, dangling a bunch of grapes over his wide-open mouth, while a servant fans him with a giant feather fan. European people, warm golden light.

A Korean neighborhood street in the 1980s. A small, plain, brand-new four-storey red-brick multi-household building. In front of it a slick Korean real-estate salesman with permed hair, a wide-lapel checked suit and a huge toothy grin dramatically yanks a cloth off a big blank signboard with a flourish, confetti and sparkles bursting around it, as if revealing a glamorous new name. A young couple in 1980s clothes stare at the blank sign with dazzled star-filled eyes and clasped hands. A blank banner hangs across the building. Daytime.

The camera will slowly pan and zoom across this picture, so paint about 8% extra scenery at every edge and keep nothing important within that margin.

A cutaway side view of one single small studio room, split exactly down the middle. The left half is an office: a desk with a computer monitor, stacks of paper, a desk phone, a swivel chair and a filing cabinet under cold white light. The right half is a bedroom: a single bed with a rumpled blanket, a bedside lamp, slippers and a tiny kitchenette under warm yellow light. Standing right on the dividing line is a tired Korean office worker who is also split in two: a neat shirt, tie and suit jacket on top, striped pajama trousers and bare feet below, holding a briefcase in one hand and a pillow in the other, yawning enormously.

Korean setting, Korean people unless stated otherwise. No text, no letters, no numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signature.

Background art only, absolutely no people and no characters. A flat, straight-on stage-like view (like a sitcom set), camera at chest height, no extreme perspective.

Match the art style of the first attached image exactly: same line weight, same skin shading, same color saturation, same level of exaggeration.

The inside of a Korean apartment living room at dusk, looking straight at a very wide window that fills most of the back wall, with light curtains pulled to both sides. Through the window, across the street, stands a red-brick building with an open pilotis car park on the ground level and exactly four residential floors above it, clearly visible and centered; behind it, taller slab-shaped apartment towers with many lit windows against an orange evening sky. A low windowsill with two small potted plants.

The camera will slowly pan and zoom across this picture, so paint about 8% extra scenery at every edge and keep nothing important within that margin.

Keep the bottom third of the picture an open, uncluttered floor: characters will be placed there later. All signs, posters, screens and labels are blank shapes with no text. 16:9 landscape, highest resolution.

Korean setting, Korean people unless stated otherwise. No text, no letters, no numbers, no logos, no watermark, no signature.

This is a single object cutout for a 2D animated video: bold readable shape, clear colors with soft shading, no people unless stated.

Match the art style of the first attached image exactly: same line weight, same skin shading, same color saturation, same level of exaggeration.

A tall slab-shaped Korean apartment block seen straight from the front: about twelve floors of identical balconies in neat rows, a flat roof with a water tank, pale gray and cream walls. Slightly chubby, toy-like proportions. No people.

The cutout will be animated (popping in, swaying, sliding across the screen), so keep it as one compact connected shape with a clean outline and no loose parts floating apart from it.

The whole subject visible with a small empty margin on every side, not cropped, centered.

Solid flat pure green (#00FF00) background filling everything around the subject: no floor, no cast shadow, no gradient, no scenery, no effects or objects outside the subject.

A slim modern glass-and-steel officetel tower seen straight from the front: about fifteen floors of blue glass curtain wall, a convenience-store-like shopfront with a blank sign on the ground floor, and one window on a middle floor where a tiny desk lamp and a tiny bed are both visible.

A Korean street at dusk with three very different places to shop standing side by side and filling the frame: on the left a huge boxy discount mart with a giant shopping cart parked in front of it, in the middle a lively traditional market alley under striped awnings with crates of vegetables and fish stalls, on the right an elegant department store with a grand glass entrance and a revolving door. A huge cartoon question mark shape floats in the sky above them. All signs are blank. No people.
